Feature: Disabling, restoring and deleting space
  As a manager of space I want to be able to disable the space first, then enable it again.
  So that a disabled space isn't accessible by shared users until it is restored,
  and so that data is protected from accidental deletion by a mandatory disable step first.
  Only a space administrator can delete a space.

  | action                           | space admin (user role) | space manager (space role) | space viewer/editor (space role) |
  | disable space                    | allowed (204)           | allowed (204)              | denied (403)                     |
  | list disabled space (/me/drives) | yes                     | yes                        | no                               |
  | enable space                     | allowed (200)           | allowed (200)              | denied (404)                     |
  | delete space                     | allowed (204)           | denied (403)               | denied (404)                     |

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "Project Moon" with the default quota using the Graph API

  Scenario Outline: disable space via the Graph API
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Brian" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has sent the following space share invitation:
      | space           | Project Moon |

      | shareType       | user         |

    When user "Brian" disables a space "Project Moon"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<code>"
    And the user "Brian" <shouldOrNot> have a space called "Project Moon"
    Examples:
      | user-role   | space-role   | code | shouldOrNot |
      | Space Admin | Space Viewer | 204  | should not  |
      | User        | Manager      | 204  | should      |

  Scenario: user can disable their own space via the Graph API
    When user "Alice" has disabled a space "Project Moon"
    And user "Alice" lists all available spaces via the Graph API with query "$filter=driveType eq 'project'"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the JSON response should contain space called "Project Moon" and match
